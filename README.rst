Get started
-----------

Retrieve the project from gitorious_:

.. _gitorious : https://git.gitorious.org/pleaseshare/pleaseshare.git

::

  $ git clone git://gitorious.org/pleaseshare/pleaseshare.git

Then install the dependencies:

::

  $ cd pleaseshare
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt

And manage it as you would do with any other django application.
Also, do not forget to use a REAL web server to handle the uploaded files, else the webseeds wonâ€™t work, since the built-in file server do not support resuming.
