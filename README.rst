PleasShare
=================

PleaseShare is a file-sharing website that aims to decentralize file-sharing through the use of torrent, DHT, and webseeds.

Get started
-----------

Retrieve the project from gitorious_:

.. _gitorious : https://git.gitorious.org/pleaseshare/pleaseshare.git

::

  $ git clone git://gitorious.org/pleaseshare/pleaseshare.git

Then install the dependencies (assuming you are using a virtualenv):

::

  $ cd pleaseshare
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt

And manage it as you would do with any other django application.
Do not forget to add your website in the "Sites" section, because the web seed generated will be using example.com if you don’t.
Also, do not forget to use a REAL web server to handle the uploaded files, else the webseeds won’t work, since the built-in file server do not support resuming file transfers.
You will also need 'tree' in order to display the torrent structure.


Misc
----

Some indications about how webseeds work might be in order.
When the torrent has a single file, then it’s easy: the webseed is the complete url of the file.
When the torrent is multifile, then the webseed url is the url of the parent directory (I’m talking about the torrents in PleaseShare, which are always contained in a parent directory named after the archive name).
For example, you upload a koin.tar.gz archive, you will have a url like /upload/48a3-[…]/, containing a 'koin' directory, that will contain the files inside the archive.
The webseed url should *not* contain the 'koin' directory, but the parent level ; and, of course, file indexing should be disabled, or the file generated by the webserver might cause problems to some clients.

So let’s say you want to add a source to the torrent using your personal webserver (again for the koin.tar.gz torrent), you will have to put something like that as a webseed: http://example.com/uploads/.
