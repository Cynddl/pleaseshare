    <h2>What is pleaseshare?</h2>
    <p>
    Pleaseshare is a file-sharing website, with "sharing" as its core value.<br/>
    It means that there wonâ€™t be a direct link on your file once you upload it, but pleaseshare will generate a torrent for you, with a webseed.<br/>
    It means that people who download the file will always get the best speed available (since there is a webseed, it will be at worst the same speed than if they downloaded it directly via http).<br/>
    It also means that the uploader can use this torrent to seed the file that is already on his computer, thus increasing the download speed for people on the other end.
    </p>
    <h2>Things to know</h2>
    <p>
    Please note that pleaseshare solely relies on DHT, which means that no trackers are needed to get peers. You can provide trackers if you want, but they are not mandatory.
    <br/>
    You must also understand that, even if pleaseshare allows you to delete the files that you upload on this server, the torrent can still stay active without a webseed.
    </p>
    <h2>Licence</h2>
    <p>
    Pleaseshare is licenced under the AGPL v3, with some GPL bits coming from the deluge client.<br/>
    And the source is <a href="https://gitorious.org/pleaseshare" title="pleaseshare source">on gitorious</a>.
